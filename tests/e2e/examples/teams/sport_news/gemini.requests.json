Argentina and Colombia locked horns in a tense encounter, with neither side able to break the deadlock in regulation time. The weight of expectation was on Argentina, seeking a record-breaking 16th Copa America title, but an early injury to Lionel Messi threatened to derail their hopes. \n\nMessi's injury, a strained hamstring suffered midway through the first half, forced him off the field, leaving his teammates and the Argentine faithful with heavy hearts. However, the Albiceleste rallied admirably, showing resilience and tactical discipline in the face of adversity. Colombia, too, adjusted their game plan, sensing an opportunity to capitalize on Messi's absence. The match became a tactical chess match, with both sides creating half-chances but unable to find the back of the net.\n\nAs the clock ticked past the 90th minute, the tension in the stadium was palpable. Extra time loomed, and with it, the prospect of penalty kicks. The deadlock was finally broken in the 112th minute. A moment of individual brilliance from substitute Angel Di Maria, who had replaced Messi, ignited the Argentine supporters. Di Maria, picking up the ball on the edge of the box, unleashed a curling effort that left the Colombian goalkeeper with no chance. \n\nThe stadium erupted in a cacophony of noise as Di Maria's shot hit the back of the net.  Argentine players and fans alike celebrated with unrestrained joy. The final whistle blew shortly after, confirming Argentina's victory and their status as champions of South America. The win marked their 16th Copa America title, further solidifying their place as the most successful team in the tournament's history.  While Messi's absence for the majority of the final was a blow, Argentina's victory was a testament to their collective strength and determination. They overcame adversity, adapted to their captain's absence, and found a way to win, etching their names into Copa America folklore once more.\"\n}\n```\n"
