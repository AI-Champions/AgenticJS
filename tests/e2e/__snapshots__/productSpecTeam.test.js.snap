        Your role is: Requirements Analyst.
        Your background is: Business Analysis.
        Your main goal is: Outline core functionalities and objectives for new features based on the founder’s input.
        Your are working as part of a team.

        For your work you will have available:

        - Access to a defined set of tools. 
        - Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
        - Must follow an specific format for your output.

        ## Tools available for your use: 

        No tools available. You must reply in your internal knowledge.

        **Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

        ## Format of your output

        You will return just one of the following:
        
        - Thought + (Action or Self Question)
        OR
        - Observation
        OR
        - Final Answer

        Below the explanation of each one:

        ### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

        {
           "thought": "your thoughts about what to next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
        }

        Examples: 

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "self_question",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

        ### Observation

        {
           "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
            "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
        }

        ### Final Answer

        IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): A functional outline of the Founder Idea

        {
            "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
        }

## User Stories

### User Registration
- **As a user**, I want to sign up for the referral program using my existing account or during registration, so that I can easily participate in the program.

### Unique Referral Links
- **As a user**, I want to receive a unique referral link, so that I can share it with others to refer them to the platform.

### Tracking Referrals
- **As a user**, I want the system to track the number of successful referrals I have made, so that I can see how my referrals contribute to my rewards.

### Reward System
- **As a user**, I want to know what rewards I can earn based on my referrals, so that I can be motivated to refer more people.

### Dashboard
- **As a user**, I want to view a dashboard that shows my referral progress, including the number of clicks, successful sign-ups, and rewards earned, so that I can monitor my achievements easily.

### Notifications
- **As a user**, I want to receive notifications about my referral status, rewards earned, and program updates, so that I am always informed.

### Admin Interface
- **As an admin**, I want an interface to manage the referral program, including setting rewards, tracking performance, and generating reports, so that I can effectively oversee the program.

### Terms and Conditions
- **As a user**, I want to view the terms and conditions of the referral program, so that I know the rules and requirements for participation.

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**: The system must support user sign-up through existing accounts or new registration with an option to enroll in the referral program.
2. **Unique Referral Links**: The system must generate a unique referral link for each user upon enrollment in the referral program.
3. **Tracking Referrals**: The system must maintain a database linking users' accounts to the number of successful referrals and provide real-time tracking.
4. **Reward System**: The system must define a set reward structure (e.g., discounts or service credits) and automatically apply this based on successful referrals.
5. **Dashboard**: The user dashboard must display referral metrics such as clicks, successful sign-ups, and earnings in a user-friendly layout.
6. **Notifications**: The system should send automated notifications to users regarding their referral activity and updates to the program.
7. **Admin Interface**: The admin interface must allow for the management of rewards, performance tracking, and report generation efficiently.
8. **Terms and Conditions**: The program must have a dedicated section outlining the terms and conditions, accessible to all users.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: The system should handle a growing number of users and referrals without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Ensure user data is protected and the referral tracking mechanism cannot be exploited.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive for both users and admins, promoting engagement with the program.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **User Registration**: Users can successfully sign up for the referral program during account creation or via their account settings.
2. **Unique Referral Links**: Each user receives a unique referral link that is functional and leads to the sign-up page.
3. **Tracking Referrals**: Successful referrals are accurately tracked and reflected in the user's account dashboard.
4. **Reward System**: Rewards are awarded automatically based on the defined criteria, and users are notified upon receiving rewards.
5. **Dashboard**: Users can see their referral stats in a clear, organized format on their dashboard.
6. **Notifications**: Users receive timely notifications related to their referrals and program changes.
7. **Admin Interface**: Admins can effectively manage rewards, view performance data, and produce reports.
8. **Terms and Conditions**: Users can access and agree to the terms and conditions without confusion on how the program operates.

## User Stories

### User Registration
- **As a user**, I want to sign up for the referral program using my existing account or during registration, so that I can easily participate in the program.

### Unique Referral Links
- **As a user**, I want to receive a unique referral link, so that I can share it with others to refer them to the platform.

### Tracking Referrals
- **As a user**, I want the system to track the number of successful referrals I have made, so that I can see how my referrals contribute to my rewards.

### Reward System
- **As a user**, I want to know what rewards I can earn based on my referrals, so that I can be motivated to refer more people.

### Dashboard
- **As a user**, I want to view a dashboard that shows my referral progress, including the number of clicks, successful sign-ups, and rewards earned, so that I can monitor my achievements easily.

### Notifications
- **As a user**, I want to receive notifications about my referral status, rewards earned, and program updates, so that I am always informed.

### Admin Interface
- **As an admin**, I want an interface to manage the referral program, including setting rewards, tracking performance, and generating reports, so that I can effectively oversee the program.

### Terms and Conditions
- **As a user**, I want to view the terms and conditions of the referral program, so that I know the rules and requirements for participation.

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**: The system must support user sign-up through existing accounts or new registration with an option to enroll in the referral program.
2. **Unique Referral Links**: The system must generate a unique referral link for each user upon enrollment in the referral program.
3. **Tracking Referrals**: The system must maintain a database linking users' accounts to the number of successful referrals and provide real-time tracking.
4. **Reward System**: The system must define a set reward structure (e.g., discounts or service credits) and automatically apply this based on successful referrals.
5. **Dashboard**: The user dashboard must display referral metrics such as clicks, successful sign-ups, and earnings in a user-friendly layout.
6. **Notifications**: The system should send automated notifications to users regarding their referral activity and updates to the program.
7. **Admin Interface**: The admin interface must allow for the management of rewards, performance tracking, and report generation efficiently.
8. **Terms and Conditions**: The program must have a dedicated section outlining the terms and conditions, accessible to all users.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: The system should handle a growing number of users and referrals without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Ensure user data is protected and the referral tracking mechanism cannot be exploited.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive for both users and admins, promoting engagement with the program.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **User Registration**: Users can successfully sign up for the referral program during account creation or via their account settings.
2. **Unique Referral Links**: Each user receives a unique referral link that is functional and leads to the sign-up page.
3. **Tracking Referrals**: Successful referrals are accurately tracked and reflected in the user's account dashboard.
4. **Reward System**: Rewards are awarded automatically based on the defined criteria, and users are notified upon receiving rewards.
5. **Dashboard**: Users can see their referral stats in a clear, organized format on their dashboard.
6. **Notifications**: Users receive timely notifications related to their referrals and program changes.
7. **Admin Interface**: Admins can effectively manage rewards, view performance data, and produce reports.
8. **Terms and Conditions**: Users can access and agree to the terms and conditions without confusion on how the program operates.

## User Stories

### User Registration
- **As a user**, I want to sign up for the referral program using my existing account or during registration, so that I can easily participate in the program.

### Unique Referral Links
- **As a user**, I want to receive a unique referral link, so that I can share it with others to refer them to the platform.

### Tracking Referrals
- **As a user**, I want the system to track the number of successful referrals I have made, so that I can see how my referrals contribute to my rewards.

### Reward System
- **As a user**, I want to know what rewards I can earn based on my referrals, so that I can be motivated to refer more people.

### Dashboard
- **As a user**, I want to view a dashboard that shows my referral progress, including the number of clicks, successful sign-ups, and rewards earned, so that I can monitor my achievements easily.

### Notifications
- **As a user**, I want to receive notifications about my referral status, rewards earned, and program updates, so that I am always informed.

### Admin Interface
- **As an admin**, I want an interface to manage the referral program, including setting rewards, tracking performance, and generating reports, so that I can effectively oversee the program.

### Terms and Conditions

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**: The system must support user sign-up through existing accounts or new registration with an option to enroll in the referral program.
2. **Unique Referral Links**: The system must generate a unique referral link for each user upon enrollment in the referral program.
3. **Tracking Referrals**: The system must maintain a database linking users' accounts to the number of successful referrals and provide real-time tracking.
4. **Reward System**: The system must define a set reward structure (e.g., discounts or service credits) and automatically apply this based on successful referrals.
5. **Dashboard**: The user dashboard must display referral metrics such as clicks, successful sign-ups, and earnings in a user-friendly layout.
6. **Notifications**: The system should send automated notifications to users regarding their referral activity and updates to the program.
7. **Admin Interface**: The admin interface must allow for the management of rewards, performance tracking, and report generation efficiently.
8. **Terms and Conditions**: The program must have a dedicated section outlining the terms and conditions, accessible to all users.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: The system should handle a growing number of users and referrals without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Ensure user data is protected and the referral tracking mechanism cannot be exploited.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive for both users and admins, promoting engagement with the program.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **User Registration**: Users can successfully sign up for the referral program during account creation or via their account settings.
2. **Unique Referral Links**: Each user receives a unique referral link that is functional and leads to the sign-up page.
3. **Tracking Referrals**: Successful referrals are accurately tracked and reflected in the user's account dashboard.
4. **Reward System**: Rewards are awarded automatically based on the defined criteria, and users are notified upon receiving rewards.
5. **Dashboard**: Users can see their referral stats in a clear, organized format on their dashboard.
6. **Notifications**: Users receive timely notifications related to their referrals and program changes.
7. **Admin Interface**: Admins can effectively manage rewards, view performance data, and produce reports.
8. **Terms and Conditions**: Users can access and agree to the terms and conditions without confusion on how the program operates.

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**: The system must support user sign-up through existing accounts or new registration with an option to enroll in the referral program.
2. **Unique Referral Links**: The system must generate a unique referral link for each user upon enrollment in the referral program.
3. **Tracking Referrals**: The system must maintain a database linking users' accounts to the number of successful referrals and provide real-time tracking.
4. **Reward System**: The system must define a set reward structure (e.g., discounts or service credits) and automatically apply this based on successful referrals.
5. **Dashboard**: The user dashboard must display referral metrics such as clicks, successful sign-ups, and earnings in a user-friendly layout.
6. **Notifications**: The system should send automated notifications to users regarding their referral activity and updates to the program.
7. **Admin Interface**: The admin interface must allow for the management of rewards, performance tracking, and report generation efficiently.
8. **Terms and Conditions**: The program must have a dedicated section outlining the terms and conditions, accessible to all users.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: The system should handle a growing number of users and referrals without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Ensure user data is protected and the referral tracking mechanism cannot be exploited.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive for both users and admins, promoting engagement with the program.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **User Registration**: Users can successfully sign up for the referral program during account creation or via their account settings.
2. **Unique Referral Links**: Each user receives a unique referral link that is functional and leads to the sign-up page.
3. **Tracking Referrals**: Successful referrals are accurately tracked and reflected in the user's account dashboard.
4. **Reward System**: Rewards are awarded automatically based on the defined criteria, and users are notified upon receiving rewards.
5. **Dashboard**: Users can see their referral stats in a clear, organized format on their dashboard.
6. **Notifications**: Users receive timely notifications related to their referrals and program changes.
7. **Admin Interface**: Admins can effectively manage rewards, view performance data, and produce reports.
8. **Terms and Conditions**: Users can access and agree to the terms and conditions without confusion on how the program operates.

## User Stories

### User Registration
- **As a user**, I want to sign up for the referral program using my existing account or during registration, so that I can easily participate in the program.

### Unique Referral Links
- **As a user**, I want to receive a unique referral link, so that I can share it with others to refer them to the platform.

### Tracking Referrals
- **As a user**, I want the system to track the number of successful referrals I have made, so that I can see how my referrals contribute to my rewards.

### Reward System
- **As a user**, I want to know what rewards I can earn based on my referrals, so that I can be motivated to refer more people.

### Dashboard
- **As a user**, I want to view a dashboard that shows my referral progress, including the number of clicks, successful sign-ups, and rewards earned, so that I can monitor my achievements easily.

### Notifications
- **As a user**, I want to receive notifications about my referral status, rewards earned, and program updates, so that I am always informed.

### Admin Interface
- **As an admin**, I want an interface to manage the referral program, including setting rewards, tracking performance, and generating reports, so that I can effectively oversee the program.

### Terms and Conditions
- **As a user**, I want to view the terms and conditions of the referral program, so that I know the rules and requirements for participation.

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**: The system must support user sign-up through existing accounts or new registration with an option to enroll in the referral program.
2. **Unique Referral Links**: The system must generate a unique referral link for each user upon enrollment in the referral program.
3. **Tracking Referrals**: The system must maintain a database linking users' accounts to the number of successful referrals and provide real-time tracking.
4. **Reward System**: The system must define a set reward structure (e.g., discounts or service credits) and automatically apply this based on successful referrals.
5. **Dashboard**: The user dashboard must display referral metrics such as clicks, successful sign-ups, and earnings in a user-friendly layout.
6. **Notifications**: The system should send automated notifications to users regarding their referral activity and updates to the program.
7. **Admin Interface**: The admin interface must allow for the management of rewards, performance tracking, and report generation efficiently.
8. **Terms and Conditions**: The program must have a dedicated section outlining the terms and conditions, accessible to all users.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: The system should handle a growing number of users and referrals without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Ensure user data is protected and the referral tracking mechanism cannot be exploited.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive for both users and admins, promoting engagement with the program.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **User Registration**: Users can successfully sign up for the referral program during account creation or via their account settings.
2. **Unique Referral Links**: Each user receives a unique referral link that is functional and leads to the sign-up page.
3. **Tracking Referrals**: Successful referrals are accurately tracked and reflected in the user's account dashboard.
4. **Reward System**: Rewards are awarded automatically based on the defined criteria, and users are notified upon receiving rewards.
5. **Dashboard**: Users can see their referral stats in a clear, organized format on their dashboard.
6. **Notifications**: Users receive timely notifications related to their referrals and program changes.
7. **Admin Interface**: Admins can effectively manage rewards, view performance data, and produce reports.
8. **Terms and Conditions**: Users can access and agree to the terms and conditions without confusion on how the program operates.

        Your role is: Requirements Analyst.
        Your background is: Business Analysis.
        Your main goal is: Outline core functionalities and objectives for new features based on the founder’s input.
        Your are working as part of a team.

        For your work you will have available:

        - Access to a defined set of tools. 
        - Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
        - Must follow an specific format for your output.

        ## Tools available for your use: 

        No tools available. You must reply in your internal knowledge.

        **Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

        ## Format of your output

        You will return just one of the following:
        
        - Thought + (Action or Self Question)
        OR
        - Observation
        OR
        - Final Answer

        Below the explanation of each one:

        ### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

        {
           "thought": "your thoughts about what to next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
        }

        Examples: 

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

        other

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "self_question",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

        ### Observation

        {
           "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
            "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
        }

        ### Final Answer

        IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): A functional outline of the Founder Idea

        {
            "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
        }

        **IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

        Your are working as part of a team.

        For your work you will have available:

        - Access to a defined set of tools. 
        - Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
        - Must follow an specific format for your output.

        ## Tools available for your use: 

        No tools available. You must reply in your internal knowledge.

        **Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

        ## Format of your output

        You will return just one of the following:
        
        - Thought + (Action or Self Question)
        OR
        - Observation

        ### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

        {
           "thought": "your thoughts about what to next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
        }

        Examples: 

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

           "action": "self_question",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

        ### Observation

        {
           "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
            "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
        }

        ### Final Answer

        {
           "thought": "your thoughts about what to next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
        }

        Examples: 

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

            "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
        }

        ### Final Answer

        IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): A functional outline of the Founder Idea

        {
            "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."

        ### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

        {
           "thought": "your thoughts about what to next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
        }

        Examples: 

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

        other

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "self_question",

            "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
        }

        ### Final Answer

        IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): A functional outline of the Founder Idea

        {
            "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
        }

        **IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.

           "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

            "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
        }

        ### Final Answer

        Your role is: Requirements Analyst.
        Your background is: Business Analysis.
        Your main goal is: Outline core functionalities and objectives for new features based on the founder’s input.
        Your are working as part of a team.

        For your work you will have available:

        - Access to a defined set of tools. 
        - Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
        - Must follow an specific format for your output.

        ## Tools available for your use: 

        No tools available. You must reply in your internal knowledge.

        **Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

        ## Format of your output

        You will return just one of the following:
        
        - Thought + (Action or Self Question)
        OR
        - Observation
        OR
        - Final Answer

        Below the explanation of each one:

        ### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

        {
           "thought": "your thoughts about what to next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
        }

        Examples: 

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

        other

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "self_question",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

        ### Observation

        {
           "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
            "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
        }

        ### Final Answer

        IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): A functional outline of the Founder Idea

        {
            "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
        }

        **IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

        Your background is: Business Analysis.
        Your main goal is: Outline core functionalities and objectives for new features based on the founder’s input.
        Your are working as part of a team.

        For your work you will have available:

        - Access to a defined set of tools. 
        - Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
        - Must follow an specific format for your output.

        ## Tools available for your use: 

        No tools available. You must reply in your internal knowledge.

        **Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

        ## Format of your output

        You will return just one of the following:
        
        - Thought + (Action or Self Question)
        OR
        - Observation
        OR
        - Final Answer

        Below the explanation of each one:

        ### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

        {
           "thought": "your thoughts about what to next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
        }

        Examples: 

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

           "action": "self_question",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

        ### Observation

        {
           "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
            "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
        }

        ### Final Answer

        IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): A functional outline of the Founder Idea

        {
            "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed technical specifications for implementing a Referral Program in a SAAS platform. The program aims to incentivize user participation and track referrals efficiently.

## User Stories
1. **User Registration**  
   As a new user, I want the option to opt into the referral program during the account registration process so that I can participate in it right away.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   As a registered user, I want a unique referral link generated for me upon opting into the referral program so that I can easily share it with others.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   As a user, I want the system to track how many referrals I have made and attribute sign-ups to my referral link so that I can see my impact on the growth of the platform.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   As a user, I want to understand the rewards I can earn through referrals, including discounts, credits, or upgrades, presented clearly in the user interface so that I can make informed referral decisions.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   As a user, I want to have a dedicated dashboard in my profile to view the number of successful referrals and the corresponding rewards I have earned.

6. **Notification System**  
   As a user, I want to receive notifications regarding my referrals' actions (such as signing up or making a purchase) so that I know when I have earned rewards.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   As an administrator, I want a comprehensive dashboard that allows me to monitor the performance of the referral program, including referral statistics and rewards distributed, so that I can manage the program effectively.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   As a user, I want to read clear guidelines regarding the referral program, including eligibility requirements and limitations, to ensure I participate within the rules.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   As a user, I want the ability to share my referral link directly on social media platforms, providing ease of sharing and increasing visibility.

## System Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**  
   - Option to opt into the referral program during account registration.
   - Capture and store user consent in the database.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   - Generate and store unique referral links upon user registration or opt-in.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   - Implement an analytics engine to track clicks and sign-ups through referral links.
   - Create a link between the referral link and the user account in the database.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   - Define multiple types of rewards (e.g., discounts, credits, upgrades) in an easily editable format.
   - Ensure that rewards are displayed to users in the dashboard.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   - Create a user interface dashboard where users can view their referral statistics.

6. **Notification System**  
   - Develop a notification system to inform users when their referrals take qualifying actions.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Implement a back-end interface for admins to monitor referral program metrics and user engagement.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   - Draft and present clear guidelines on the user interface, making it accessible to users.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   - Integrate sharing functionalities using APIs from popular social media platforms.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The application must ensure data integrity and security, especially regarding user data and referral tracking.
- The system should handle concurrent accesses without performance degradation, especially in the analytics engine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users must be able to opt into the referral program at the point of registration.
2. Each user receives a unique referral link immediately after opting into the program.
3. The system must show accurate tracking of how many referrals a user has made on their dashboard.
4. Users can only see their rewards after a referral has successfully completed qualifying criteria.
5. The admin dashboard must display total referrals, rewards distributed, and user engagement metrics.
6. Users can access and understand the referral program's terms and conditions without confusion.
7. The referral links must be easily shareable to social media platforms from the user dashboard.

## Conclusion
This technical specifications document will guide the development of the referral program in a structured manner, ensuring all functional and non-functional requirements are met while improving user engagement and platform growth.",

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed technical specifications for implementing a Referral Program in a SAAS platform. The program aims to incentivize user participation and track referrals efficiently.

## User Stories
1. **User Registration**  
   As a new user, I want the option to opt into the referral program during the account registration process so that I can participate in it right away.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   As a registered user, I want a unique referral link generated for me upon opting into the referral program so that I can easily share it with others.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   As a user, I want the system to track how many referrals I have made and attribute sign-ups to my referral link so that I can see my impact on the growth of the platform.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   As a user, I want to understand the rewards I can earn through referrals, including discounts, credits, or upgrades, presented clearly in the user interface so that I can make informed referral decisions.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   As a user, I want to have a dedicated dashboard in my profile to view the number of successful referrals and the corresponding rewards I have earned.

6. **Notification System**  
   As a user, I want to receive notifications regarding my referrals' actions (such as signing up or making a purchase) so that I know when I have earned rewards.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   As an administrator, I want a comprehensive dashboard that allows me to monitor the performance of the referral program, including referral statistics and rewards distributed, so that I can manage the program effectively.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   As a user, I want to read clear guidelines regarding the referral program, including eligibility requirements and limitations, to ensure I participate within the rules.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   As a user, I want the ability to share my referral link directly on social media platforms, providing ease of sharing and increasing visibility.

## System Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**  
   - Option to opt into the referral program during account registration.
   - Capture and store user consent in the database.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   - Generate and store unique referral links upon user registration or opt-in.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   - Implement an analytics engine to track clicks and sign-ups through referral links.
   - Create a link between the referral link and the user account in the database.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   - Define multiple types of rewards (e.g., discounts, credits, upgrades) in an easily editable format.
   - Ensure that rewards are displayed to users in the dashboard.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   - Create a user interface dashboard where users can view their referral statistics.

6. **Notification System**  
   - Develop a notification system to inform users when their referrals take qualifying actions.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Implement a back-end interface for admins to monitor referral program metrics and user engagement.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   - Draft and present clear guidelines on the user interface, making it accessible to users.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   - Integrate sharing functionalities using APIs from popular social media platforms.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The application must ensure data integrity and security, especially regarding user data and referral tracking.
- The system should handle concurrent accesses without performance degradation, especially in the analytics engine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users must be able to opt into the referral program at the point of registration.
2. Each user receives a unique referral link immediately after opting into the program.
3. The system must show accurate tracking of how many referrals a user has made on their dashboard.
4. Users can only see their rewards after a referral has successfully completed qualifying criteria.
5. The admin dashboard must display total referrals, rewards distributed, and user engagement metrics.
6. Users can access and understand the referral program's terms and conditions without confusion.
7. The referral links must be easily shareable to social media platforms from the user dashboard.

## Conclusion
This technical specifications document will guide the development of the referral program in a structured manner, ensuring all functional and non-functional requirements are met while improving user engagement and platform growth.",

4. Incentive Structure: Establish various reward types (e.g., discounts, credits, or upgrades) for successful referrals, which need to be clearly defined in the user interface.
5. Dashboard for Users: A section in the user profile where users can see how many people they referred and the rewards they’ve earned.
6. Notification System: Users should be notified when their referrals complete certain actions (like signing up or making a purchase) that qualify for rewards.
7. Admin Dashboard: A back-end module for administrators to monitor the referral program's performance, including total referrals, rewards distributed, and an overview of user engagement within the program. 
8. Terms and Conditions: Clear guidelines regarding the referral program, including eligibility, limitations, and potential penalties for abuse.

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed technical specifications for implementing a Referral Program in a SAAS platform. The program aims to incentivize user participation and track referrals efficiently.

## User Stories
1. **User Registration**  
   As a new user, I want the option to opt into the referral program during the account registration process so that I can participate in it right away.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   As a registered user, I want a unique referral link generated for me upon opting into the referral program so that I can easily share it with others.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   As a user, I want the system to track how many referrals I have made and attribute sign-ups to my referral link so that I can see my impact on the growth of the platform.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   As a user, I want to understand the rewards I can earn through referrals, including discounts, credits, or upgrades, presented clearly in the user interface so that I can make informed referral decisions.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   As a user, I want to have a dedicated dashboard in my profile to view the number of successful referrals and the corresponding rewards I have earned.

6. **Notification System**  
   As a user, I want to receive notifications regarding my referrals' actions (such as signing up or making a purchase) so that I know when I have earned rewards.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   As an administrator, I want a comprehensive dashboard that allows me to monitor the performance of the referral program, including referral statistics and rewards distributed, so that I can manage the program effectively.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   As a user, I want to read clear guidelines regarding the referral program, including eligibility requirements and limitations, to ensure I participate within the rules.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   As a user, I want the ability to share my referral link directly on social media platforms, providing ease of sharing and increasing visibility.

## System Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**  
   - Option to opt into the referral program during account registration.
   - Capture and store user consent in the database.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   - Generate and store unique referral links upon user registration or opt-in.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   - Implement an analytics engine to track clicks and sign-ups through referral links.
   - Create a link between the referral link and the user account in the database.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   - Define multiple types of rewards (e.g., discounts, credits, upgrades) in an easily editable format.
   - Ensure that rewards are displayed to users in the dashboard.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   - Create a user interface dashboard where users can view their referral statistics.

6. **Notification System**  
   - Develop a notification system to inform users when their referrals take qualifying actions.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Implement a back-end interface for admins to monitor referral program metrics and user engagement.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   - Draft and present clear guidelines on the user interface, making it accessible to users.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   - Integrate sharing functionalities using APIs from popular social media platforms.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The application must ensure data integrity and security, especially regarding user data and referral tracking.
- The system should handle concurrent accesses without performance degradation, especially in the analytics engine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users must be able to opt into the referral program at the point of registration.
2. Each user receives a unique referral link immediately after opting into the program.
3. The system must show accurate tracking of how many referrals a user has made on their dashboard.
4. Users can only see their rewards after a referral has successfully completed qualifying criteria.
5. The admin dashboard must display total referrals, rewards distributed, and user engagement metrics.
6. Users can access and understand the referral program's terms and conditions without confusion.
7. The referral links must be easily shareable to social media platforms from the user dashboard.

## Conclusion
This technical specifications document will guide the development of the referral program in a structured manner, ensuring all functional and non-functional requirements are met while improving user engagement and platform growth.",

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed technical specifications for implementing a Referral Program in a SAAS platform. The program aims to incentivize user participation and track referrals efficiently.

## User Stories
1. **User Registration**  
   As a new user, I want the option to opt into the referral program during the account registration process so that I can participate in it right away.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   As a registered user, I want a unique referral link generated for me upon opting into the referral program so that I can easily share it with others.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   As a user, I want the system to track how many referrals I have made and attribute sign-ups to my referral link so that I can see my impact on the growth of the platform.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   As a user, I want to understand the rewards I can earn through referrals, including discounts, credits, or upgrades, presented clearly in the user interface so that I can make informed referral decisions.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   As a user, I want to have a dedicated dashboard in my profile to view the number of successful referrals and the corresponding rewards I have earned.

6. **Notification System**  
   As a user, I want to receive notifications regarding my referrals' actions (such as signing up or making a purchase) so that I know when I have earned rewards.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   As an administrator, I want a comprehensive dashboard that allows me to monitor the performance of the referral program, including referral statistics and rewards distributed, so that I can manage the program effectively.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   As a user, I want to read clear guidelines regarding the referral program, including eligibility requirements and limitations, to ensure I participate within the rules.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   As a user, I want the ability to share my referral link directly on social media platforms, providing ease of sharing and increasing visibility.

## System Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**  
   - Option to opt into the referral program during account registration.
   - Capture and store user consent in the database.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   - Generate and store unique referral links upon user registration or opt-in.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   - Implement an analytics engine to track clicks and sign-ups through referral links.
   - Create a link between the referral link and the user account in the database.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   - Define multiple types of rewards (e.g., discounts, credits, upgrades) in an easily editable format.
   - Ensure that rewards are displayed to users in the dashboard.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   - Create a user interface dashboard where users can view their referral statistics.

6. **Notification System**  
   - Develop a notification system to inform users when their referrals take qualifying actions.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Implement a back-end interface for admins to monitor referral program metrics and user engagement.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   - Draft and present clear guidelines on the user interface, making it accessible to users.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   - Integrate sharing functionalities using APIs from popular social media platforms.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The application must ensure data integrity and security, especially regarding user data and referral tracking.
- The system should handle concurrent accesses without performance degradation, especially in the analytics engine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users must be able to opt into the referral program at the point of registration.
2. Each user receives a unique referral link immediately after opting into the program.
3. The system must show accurate tracking of how many referrals a user has made on their dashboard.
4. Users can only see their rewards after a referral has successfully completed qualifying criteria.
5. The admin dashboard must display total referrals, rewards distributed, and user engagement metrics.
6. Users can access and understand the referral program's terms and conditions without confusion.
7. The referral links must be easily shareable to social media platforms from the user dashboard.

## Conclusion
This technical specifications document will guide the development of the referral program in a structured manner, ensuring all functional and non-functional requirements are met while improving user engagement and platform growth.",

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed technical specifications for implementing a Referral Program in a SAAS platform. The program aims to incentivize user participation and track referrals efficiently.

## User Stories
1. **User Registration**  
   As a new user, I want the option to opt into the referral program during the account registration process so that I can participate in it right away.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   As a registered user, I want a unique referral link generated for me upon opting into the referral program so that I can easily share it with others.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   As a user, I want the system to track how many referrals I have made and attribute sign-ups to my referral link so that I can see my impact on the growth of the platform.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   As a user, I want to understand the rewards I can earn through referrals, including discounts, credits, or upgrades, presented clearly in the user interface so that I can make informed referral decisions.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   As a user, I want to have a dedicated dashboard in my profile to view the number of successful referrals and the corresponding rewards I have earned.

6. **Notification System**  
   As a user, I want to receive notifications regarding my referrals' actions (such as signing up or making a purchase) so that I know when I have earned rewards.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   As an administrator, I want a comprehensive dashboard that allows me to monitor the performance of the referral program, including referral statistics and rewards distributed, so that I can manage the program effectively.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   As a user, I want to read clear guidelines regarding the referral program, including eligibility requirements and limitations, to ensure I participate within the rules.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   As a user, I want the ability to share my referral link directly on social media platforms, providing ease of sharing and increasing visibility.

## System Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**  
   - Option to opt into the referral program during account registration.
   - Capture and store user consent in the database.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   - Generate and store unique referral links upon user registration or opt-in.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   - Implement an analytics engine to track clicks and sign-ups through referral links.
   - Create a link between the referral link and the user account in the database.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   - Define multiple types of rewards (e.g., discounts, credits, upgrades) in an easily editable format.
   - Ensure that rewards are displayed to users in the dashboard.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   - Create a user interface dashboard where users can view their referral statistics.

6. **Notification System**  
   - Develop a notification system to inform users when their referrals take qualifying actions.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Implement a back-end interface for admins to monitor referral program metrics and user engagement.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   - Draft and present clear guidelines on the user interface, making it accessible to users.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   - Integrate sharing functionalities using APIs from popular social media platforms.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The application must ensure data integrity and security, especially regarding user data and referral tracking.
- The system should handle concurrent accesses without performance degradation, especially in the analytics engine.

## Acceptance Criteria

6. **Notification System**  
   As a user, I want to receive notifications regarding my referrals' actions (such as signing up or making a purchase) so that I know when I have earned rewards.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   As an administrator, I want a comprehensive dashboard that allows me to monitor the performance of the referral program, including referral statistics and rewards distributed, so that I can manage the program effectively.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   As a user, I want to read clear guidelines regarding the referral program, including eligibility requirements and limitations, to ensure I participate within the rules.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   As a user, I want the ability to share my referral link directly on social media platforms, providing ease of sharing and increasing visibility.

1. User Registration: If a user wants to participate in the referral program, they should have to opt-in during the account registration process.
2. Unique Referral Links: Upon registration or opting into the program, users should be generated a unique referral link that they can share with others.
3. Referral Tracking: The system should track referral sign-ups and attribute them to the referring user. This requires an analytics engine to monitor who signed up via referral links.
4. Incentive Structure: Establish various reward types (e.g., discounts, credits, or upgrades) for successful referrals, which need to be clearly defined in the user interface.
5. Dashboard for Users: A section in the user profile where users can see how many people they referred and the rewards they’ve earned.
6. Notification System: Users should be notified when their referrals complete certain actions (like signing up or making a purchase) that qualify for rewards.
7. Admin Dashboard: A back-end module for administrators to monitor the referral program's performance, including total referrals, rewards distributed, and an overview of user engagement within the program. 
8. Terms and Conditions: Clear guidelines regarding the referral program, including eligibility, limitations, and potential penalties for abuse.
9. Social Media Integration: An option to share referral links directly on various social media platforms to enhance visibility and ease of sharing.

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed technical specifications for implementing a Referral Program in a SAAS platform. The program aims to incentivize user participation and track referrals efficiently.

## User Stories
1. **User Registration**  
   As a new user, I want the option to opt into the referral program during the account registration process so that I can participate in it right away.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   As a registered user, I want a unique referral link generated for me upon opting into the referral program so that I can easily share it with others.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   As a user, I want the system to track how many referrals I have made and attribute sign-ups to my referral link so that I can see my impact on the growth of the platform.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   As a user, I want to understand the rewards I can earn through referrals, including discounts, credits, or upgrades, presented clearly in the user interface so that I can make informed referral decisions.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   As a user, I want to have a dedicated dashboard in my profile to view the number of successful referrals and the corresponding rewards I have earned.

6. **Notification System**  
   As a user, I want to receive notifications regarding my referrals' actions (such as signing up or making a purchase) so that I know when I have earned rewards.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   As an administrator, I want a comprehensive dashboard that allows me to monitor the performance of the referral program, including referral statistics and rewards distributed, so that I can manage the program effectively.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   As a user, I want to read clear guidelines regarding the referral program, including eligibility requirements and limitations, to ensure I participate within the rules.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   As a user, I want the ability to share my referral link directly on social media platforms, providing ease of sharing and increasing visibility.

## System Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**  
   - Option to opt into the referral program during account registration.
   - Capture and store user consent in the database.

2. **Unique Referral Links**  
   - Generate and store unique referral links upon user registration or opt-in.

3. **Referral Tracking**  
   - Implement an analytics engine to track clicks and sign-ups through referral links.
   - Create a link between the referral link and the user account in the database.

4. **Incentive Structure**  
   - Define multiple types of rewards (e.g., discounts, credits, upgrades) in an easily editable format.
   - Ensure that rewards are displayed to users in the dashboard.

5. **Dashboard for Users**  
   - Create a user interface dashboard where users can view their referral statistics.

6. **Notification System**  
   - Develop a notification system to inform users when their referrals take qualifying actions.

7. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Implement a back-end interface for admins to monitor referral program metrics and user engagement.

8. **Terms and Conditions**  
   - Draft and present clear guidelines on the user interface, making it accessible to users.

9. **Social Media Integration**  
   - Integrate sharing functionalities using APIs from popular social media platforms.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The application must ensure data integrity and security, especially regarding user data and referral tracking.
- The system should handle concurrent accesses without performance degradation, especially in the analytics engine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users must be able to opt into the referral program at the point of registration.
2. Each user receives a unique referral link immediately after opting into the program.
3. The system must show accurate tracking of how many referrals a user has made on their dashboard.
4. Users can only see their rewards after a referral has successfully completed qualifying criteria.
5. The admin dashboard must display total referrals, rewards distributed, and user engagement metrics.
6. Users can access and understand the referral program's terms and conditions without confusion.
7. The referral links must be easily shareable to social media platforms from the user dashboard.

## Conclusion
This technical specifications document will guide the development of the referral program in a structured manner, ensuring all functional and non-functional requirements are met while improving user engagement and platform growth.",

        ### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

        {
           "thought": "your thoughts about what to next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
        }

        Examples: 

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "self_question",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

        ### Observation

        {
           "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
            "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
        }

        ### Final Answer

        IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): A validated technical specifications document ready for development. Must be in Markdown format.

        {
            "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
        }

        **IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.
