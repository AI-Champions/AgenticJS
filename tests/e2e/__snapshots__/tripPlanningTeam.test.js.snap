        - Must follow an specific format for your output.

        ## Tools available for your use: 

        tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

        **Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

        ## Format of your output

        You will return just one of the following:
        
        - Thought + (Action or Self Question)
        OR
        - Observation

           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
        }

        Examples: 

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

           "action": "self_question",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

            "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
        }

        ### Final Answer

     including flight costs, 
     weather forecast and attractions

        {
            "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."

        {
           "thought": "your thoughts about what to next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
        }

        Examples:

        }

     including flight costs, 
     weather forecast and attractions

        {
            "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."

Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

        **Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

           "thought": "your thoughts about what to next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
           "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought",// the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
           "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
        }

        Examples: 

        {
           "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
           "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

        other

           "action": "self_question",
           "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
        }

        ### Observation

        {
           "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
            "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
        }

        ### Final Answer

        IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed report on the chosen city,
     including flight costs, 
     weather forecast and attractions

        {
            "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
        }
