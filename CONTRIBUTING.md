## Contributing to AgenticJS

We appreciate your interest in contributing to AgenticJS! Here are a few guidelines to help you get started:

### How to Contribute

1. **Explore Issues**: Start by looking through the [issues](https://github.com/AI-Champions/AgenticJS/issues) on GitHub. Pick an issue that interests you, and please check if it has the **"in progress"** label, which means someone is already working on it. If you have a new idea or have found a bug, feel free to submit a new issue. Ensure the issue you choose is not already being worked on by someone else.

2. **Fork and Clone**: Fork the AgenticJS repository and then clone your fork. This will set you up with a local version of the project to work on.

3. **Branch Creation**: Create a new branch in your local repository. It helps to name your branch in a way that reflects the work you're doing. For example, `feature/add-new-agent` or `bugfix/resolve-dependency-issue`.

4. **Development**: Make your changes in the newly created branch. Be sure to keep your changes as concise and focused as possible. If the changes are large or complex, consider splitting them into multiple smaller pull requests.

5. **Write Tests**: We love tests! Writing tests for new code or fixing existing tests are both valuable contributions. Ensure that all tests pass when you run `npm test`.

6. **Document Your Changes**: Update the documentation to reflect any changes you've made. This might include new features, changes to existing functionalities, or updates to the setup/installation process.

7. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages, describing what has changed and why.

8. **Pull Request**: Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the main AgenticJS repository. Provide a clear description of the problem and solution, including any relevant issue numbers.

9. **Code Review**: Wait for the code review process. The community or maintainers will review your pull request. Engage in the conversation and make any requested changes. This collaboration greatly increases the chances that your pull request will be accepted.

10. **Stay Updated**: Keep your pull request updated with the main branch, especially if other changes that might affect your contribution are merged.
