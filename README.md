# AgenticJS
AgenticJS is a JavaScript-native framework for building multi-agent AI systems.

## Try It Out

[Explore the Playground](https://agenticjs.com) â€” *it's like Trello or Asana, but for AI Agents and humans.*

## Getting Started

### Install AgenticJS via npm:

```bash
npm install agenticjs --save
```

### Import AgenticJS in your JavaScript file:

```js
// Using ES6 import syntax for NextJS, React, etc.
import { Agent, Task, Team } from 'agenticjs';
```

```js
// Using CommonJS syntax for NodeJS
const { Agent, Task, Team } = require("agenticjs");
```

## Example Usage

In this example, we use AgenticJS to build a resume generation team. If you're looking to create or update your resume, this setup utilizes specialized AI agents to automatically process your information and produce a polished, professional resume tailored to your career goals.

```js

// Define agents with specific roles and goals
const profileAnalyst = new Agent({
    name: 'Ivy', 
    role: 'Profile Analyst', 
    goal: 'Extract structured information from conversational user input.', 
    background: 'Data Processor',
    tools: [],  // Tools are omitted for now  
});

const formatter = new Agent({
    name: 'Formy', 
    role: 'Formatter', 
    goal: 'Format structured information into a professional resume.', 
    background: 'Document Formatter',
    tools: [],  
});

// Define the tasks for each agent
const processingTask = new Task({ 
    description: `Extract relevant details such as name, experience, skills, and job history from the user's 'aboutMe' input. 
    aboutMe: {aboutMe}`,
    expectedOutput: 'Structured data ready for formatting.', 
    agent: profileAnalyst
});

const formattingTask = new Task({ 
    description: `Use the extracted information to create a clean, professional resume layout tailored for a JavaScript Developer. Please enhance the provided information with more details, to make the resume appealing for potential recruiters.`,
    expectedOutput: 'A well-formatted resume in PDF format.', 
    agent: formatter 
});

// Create and start the team
const team = new Team({
    name: 'Resume Creation Team',
    agents: [profileAnalyst, formatter],
    tasks: [processingTask, formattingTask],
    inputs: { aboutMe: 'My name is Will, I have been a Javascript Developer for 3 years. I know React, NextJS, and REDUX. My latest job was as a Junior Developer at Disney creating UIs for the main landing page.' },  // Initial input for the first task
    env: {OPENAI_API_KEY: 'your-open-ai-api-key'}  // Environment variables for the team
});

const result = await team.start();
console.log("Final Output:", result);
```

## Basic Concepts

**Agents** 
Agents are autonomous entities designed to perform specific roles and achieve goals based on the tasks assigned to them. They are like super-powered LLMs that can execute tasks in a loop until they arrive at the final answer.

**Tasks**
Tasks define the specific actions each agent must take, their expected outputs, and mark critical outputs as deliverables if they are the final products.

**Team**
The Team coordinates the agents and their tasks. It starts with an initial input and manages the flow of information between tasks.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Agent Design:** Design agents with specific roles and goals.
- **Flexible Task Management:** Define and assign tasks dynamically to agents.
- **Redux-Inspired Architecture:** This architecture offers a unified approach to managing the states of all AI agents. As a big plus, it integrates effortlessly into your React applications.
- **Real-Time Visualizer:** Built-in UI visualizer for development and debugging.
- **Browser and Server Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across client and server environments.
- **Multi-Model Support:** Integrates with various AI models including OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, and Mistral, enhancing versatility and adaptability.

### Compatibility

AgenticJS aims to be compatible with major front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, and NextJS, making it a versatile choice for developers. The JavaScript ecosystem is a "bit complex...". If you have any problems, please tell us and we'll help you fix them.

## Why AgenticJS?

There are about 20 million JavaScript developers worldwide, yet most AI frameworks are originally written in Python. Others are mere adaptations for JavaScript. 

This puts all of us **JavaScript developers at a disadvantage in the AI race**. But not anymore...

AgenticJS changes the game by aiming to offer a robust, easy-to-use AI multi-agent framework designed specifically for the JavaScript ecosystem.

```js
const writtenBy = `Another JS Dev Who Doesn't Want to Learn Python to do meaningful AI Stuff.`;
console.log(writtenBy);
```
